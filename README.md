This project is about lighting the jack-o'-lantern by changing the SVG's color. To be honest, this is my favorite part in this course till now! The reason is that I can paint the SVG by myself in Figma and create the animation effects, which is so interesting!

I created this pumpkin and its top, eyes by changing the circle, square and triangle; created the mouth by pen.

In the class assignment of SVG before, I created a panda. Then I used CSS to make its eyes change size. After that, when I tried to make its eyes change color by using toggle, I met some trouble that I only made one of them turn blue first time, because the eyes are in the different paths. Then I had to change both eyes blue by using "Element.querySelectorAll()". In this project, I also wanted to design the similar one. This time I set the eyes and mouth in the same path so that it allows me to do it more easily. I am thinking about how to light it step by step, like making the body black first,then light the eyes ,at last light the mouth.
